    _METHODOLOGY_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the agent's methodology in computing the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of \
monthly net budget receipts from excise taxes for FY2018.
The correct answer is 1,400.306 million dollars.
Score each of the three parts separately, then compute a weighted final score (0-1).

=== Part 1: MAD Computation Method (weight 45%) ===
The agent needed to:
- Understand MAD formula: (1/n) × Σ|xi - mean| where n=12 months
- First compute the mean of all 12 monthly values
- Then compute the absolute deviation of each month from the mean
- Average the absolute deviations
- Show computation steps with actual monthly values

Part 1 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Correct MAD formula stated, showed mean computation, showed deviations, \
correct final result
- 0.7-0.8: Correct formula and result but intermediate steps abbreviated
- 0.5-0.6: Used MAD concept correctly but some computational errors
- 0.2-0.4: Attempted deviation calculation but wrong formula (e.g., standard deviation)
- 0.0-0.1: No statistical computation attempted

=== Part 2: Data Extraction (weight 30%) ===
- Extracted all 12 monthly excise tax receipt values for FY2018
- Correctly identified FY2018 as October 2017 through September 2018
- Found the correct table (net budget receipts, excise taxes category)
- Handled OCR data quality issues appropriately

Part 2 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: All 12 months extracted from correct table with correct FY period
- 0.7-0.8: Most months extracted correctly, minor gaps
- 0.4-0.6: Some monthly data found but incomplete or wrong table
- 0.0-0.3: Failed to extract monthly data

=== Part 3: Answer Presentation (weight 25%) ===
- Reported with correct precision (thousandths place: 1400.306)
- Stated units (millions of dollars)
- Explained what MAD measures in this context

Part 3 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Correct precision, correct units, explained MAD meaning
- 0.6-0.8: Correct precision and units but no explanation
- 0.3-0.5: Answer given but wrong precision or missing units
- 0.0-0.2: No clear answer

Output the final weighted score: score = 0.45×Part1 + 0.30×Part2 + 0.25×Part3"""

    _REASONING_QUALITY_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the quality of the agent's reasoning in finding the highest spending \
U.S. Federal Department in FY1955 from a Treasury Bulletin.
Score each of the three parts separately, then compute a weighted final score (0-1).

=== Part 1: Department Identification & Comparison (weight 45%) ===
The agent needed to compare spending across multiple departments and identify \
the highest one (Department of Defense at 36,080 million):
- Did it explicitly state that Defense / Department of Defense had the highest spending?
- Did it list or compare multiple departments' spending figures to justify this?
- Did it show the comparison logic (not just assert the answer)?

Part 1 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clearly identified Defense as highest, compared with other departments' \
figures to demonstrate this
- 0.7-0.8: Identified Defense as highest with some supporting comparison
- 0.5-0.6: Identified Defense as highest but no comparison shown
- 0.2-0.4: Mentioned Defense but didn't clearly state it was the highest
- 0.0-0.1: Didn't identify the department or named wrong one

=== Part 2: Data Source & Extraction (weight 25%) ===
- Referenced the Treasury Bulletin (October 1958) as data source
- Identified the correct table/section (department expenditures, FY1955)
- Distinguished fiscal year from calendar year

Part 2 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear data source reference and table identification
- 0.6-0.8: Mentioned source but table identification unclear
- 0.3-0.5: Gave answer without explaining source
- 0.0-0.2: No source reference

=== Part 3: Answer Presentation (weight 30%) ===
- Stated both the department name AND the amount with units
- Provided context (fiscal year 1955, millions of dollars)
- Clear and precise final answer

Part 3 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Complete answer (dept name + amount + units + context)
- 0.6-0.8: Has dept and amount but missing units or context
- 0.3-0.5: Only number or only department name
- 0.0-0.2: No clear answer

Output the final weighted score: score = 0.45×Part1 + 0.25×Part2 + 0.30×Part3"""

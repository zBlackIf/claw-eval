## Three Core Trends That Must Be Identified

### Trend 1: AI Acceleration -> Manufacturing is the Biggest Opportunity
- External signal: AI tools up 120% (RSS-1201), manufacturing investment +35% (RSS-1204)
- CRM validation: 3 manufacturing customers (2 VIP), Dingsheng Machinery evaluating Competitor A's AI
- Internal capability: AI lagging competitors (KB-1202), but Q2 launch planned
- Sales feedback (msg_1202): Customers proactively asking about AI features
- Strategic recommendation: Accelerate AI capability development, prioritize manufacturing VIP customers

### Trend 2: Healthcare IT -> Policy-Driven Growth
- External signal: Tier-A hospital upgrades 50B CNY market (RSS-1206), hybrid cloud demand (RSS-1202)
- CRM validation: 2 healthcare customers, VIP Tier-A hospital group

- Strategic recommendation: Seize policy window, deepen healthcare vertical

### Trend 3: SaaS Renewal Rate Declining -> Risk Warning
- External signal: NRR dropped from 118% to 109% (RSS-1203), SME churn 22%
- CRM validation: Education sector already has churn (CUS-1207)
- Internal data: Q1 renewal rate down 3% (KB-1205), standard customer renewal 78% (KB-1204)
- Strategic recommendation: Strengthen customer success programs, focus on preventing standard customer churn

## Cross-Source Correlation Quality
- Whether RSS external trends were compared against CRM internal customer data
- Whether KB historical data was contrasted with latest RSS information to identify changes
- Whether sales feedback (email) was connected with customer data (CRM) and industry trends (RSS)

## Strict scoring
- 0.9-1.0: All three trends complete, deep cross-source correlation, data-backed strategic recommendations
- 0.6-0.8: 2-3 trends identified, some correlation analysis
- 0.3-0.5: Only listed information without cross-analysis

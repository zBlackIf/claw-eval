    _REASONING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the agent's reasoning in computing the absolute change in highest quality \
corporate bond yield from the end of WWII (1945) to the start of the Korean War (1950).
The correct answer is 0.24 percentage points.
Score each of the three parts separately, then compute a weighted final score (0-1).

=== Part 1: Historical Period Identification (weight 30%) ===
The agent needed to:
- Correctly identify 1945 as the calendar year marking the end of World War II
- Correctly identify 1950 as the calendar year the Korean War began
- Use calendar year averages (not fiscal year) as specified in the question

Part 1 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Both years correctly identified with historical justification
- 0.7-0.8: Both years correct but no historical context
- 0.4-0.6: One year correct, other wrong or ambiguous
- 0.0-0.3: Neither year correctly identified

=== Part 2: Yield Data Extraction & Computation (weight 45%) ===
- Located the correct table with corporate Aa bond yields in the Treasury Bulletin
- Extracted yield values for both 1945 and 1950
- Computed absolute change correctly (|yield_1950 - yield_1945|)
- Showed the computation steps

Part 2 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Both yields extracted, computation shown step-by-step, correct result
- 0.7-0.8: Correct computation but steps not fully shown
- 0.4-0.6: Found relevant data but computation errors
- 0.0-0.3: Failed to extract yield data or completely wrong computation

=== Part 3: Answer Presentation (weight 25%) ===
- Stated the answer with appropriate units (percentage points)
- Referenced the bond quality grade (Aa / highest quality)
- Provided context (direction of change, which year was higher)

Part 3 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear answer with units, bond grade reference, and direction of change
- 0.6-0.8: Answer with units but missing context
- 0.3-0.5: Just a number without proper context
- 0.0-0.2: No clear answer

Output the final weighted score: score = 0.30×Part1 + 0.45×Part2 + 0.25×Part3"""

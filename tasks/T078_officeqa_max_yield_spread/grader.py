    _ANALYSIS_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the agent's analytical reasoning in finding the month with maximum \
yield spread between US corporate Aa bonds and US Treasury bonds during 1960-1969.
The correct answer is 031969 (March 1969 in MMYYYY format).
Score each of the three parts separately, then compute a weighted final score (0-1).

=== Part 1: Yield Spread Computation & Comparison (weight 45%) ===
The agent needed to:
- Identify or compute yield spreads for each month across 1960-1969
- Compare spreads across the full 10-year period to find the maximum
- Show its work: which months/years had high spreads, how it determined the max

Part 1 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Showed spread values for multiple months/years, clearly demonstrated \
March 1969 had the maximum with supporting data
- 0.7-0.8: Identified March 1969 as max with some supporting data but incomplete comparison
- 0.5-0.6: Found a high-spread period (late 1960s) but didn't precisely identify March 1969
- 0.2-0.4: Attempted spread calculation but major errors or incomplete
- 0.0-0.1: No spread computation or comparison attempted

=== Part 2: Data Source & Table Identification (weight 25%) ===
- Referenced the Treasury Bulletin (June 1970) as source
- Identified the correct table with corporate Aa bond yields AND Treasury bond yields
- Correctly understood that spread = corporate yield - Treasury yield (or similar)

Part 2 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear source reference, correct table identified, spread definition understood
- 0.6-0.8: Source mentioned, table roughly identified
- 0.3-0.5: Gave answer without clear table reference
- 0.0-0.2: No source or table identification

=== Part 3: Answer Format & Presentation (weight 30%) ===
- Correctly formatted answer as MMYYYY integer (031969 for March 1969)
- Explained what the number represents (month=03, year=1969)
- Stated the actual spread value at that peak month

Part 3 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Correct MMYYYY format, explained the encoding, stated the peak spread value
- 0.6-0.8: Correct format but didn't explain encoding or omitted spread value
- 0.3-0.5: Identified March 1969 but wrong format (e.g., "March 1969" instead of 031969)
- 0.0-0.2: No clear answer or completely wrong format

Output the final weighted score: score = 0.45×Part1 + 0.25×Part2 + 0.30×Part3"""

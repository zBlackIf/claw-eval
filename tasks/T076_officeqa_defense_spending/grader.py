    _ANSWER_QUALITY_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the quality of the agent's answer explanation for finding U.S. national \
defense expenditures in 1940 from a Treasury Bulletin.
Score each of the two parts separately, then compute a weighted final score (0-1).

=== Part 1: Data Source & Extraction Process (weight 50%) ===
The agent should demonstrate it correctly processed the OCR output:
- Referenced the Treasury Bulletin as the data source
- Identified the correct table/section containing defense expenditures
- Showed how it located the 1940 calendar year data
- Distinguished between fiscal year and calendar year if relevant

Part 1 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clearly described data source and extraction process, referenced \
specific table/section
- 0.6-0.8: Mentioned data source but extraction process unclear
- 0.3-0.5: Gave an answer without explaining how it was found
- 0.0-0.2: No reference to data source or extraction method

=== Part 2: Answer Presentation & Context (weight 50%) ===
The agent should present the answer clearly with appropriate context:
- Stated the answer with correct units (millions of dollars)
- Provided context (e.g., "national defense" category, calendar year 1940)
- Noted any caveats or data quality issues from OCR

Part 2 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear answer with units, context, and any relevant caveats
- 0.6-0.8: Answer with units but minimal context
- 0.3-0.5: Just a number without units or context
- 0.0-0.2: No clear answer presented

Output the final weighted score: score = 0.50×Part1 + 0.50×Part2"""

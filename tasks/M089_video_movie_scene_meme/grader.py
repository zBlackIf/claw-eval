"""Grader for M089_video_movie_scene_meme: Movie Scene Localization - Driver Meme Creation.

Task: Find the RV driver's shocked expression at ~00:24, extract a face close-up
frame, add "wow" text to create a meme, save as /workspace/meme.png.

GT reference image: fixtures/gt.png (the driver's shocked face)

Scoring (total = 1.0):
  - 0.2: meme.png file exists
  - 0.4: face match — the person in meme.png matches the GT driver (visual comparison)
  - 0.4: meme quality — text "wow" is visible, meme style formatting

You are comparing two images from a movie clip.

The REFERENCE image (first) shows the ground-truth: an RV driver with a shocked \
expression. He is a middle-aged man with a hat and beard, wearing a light blue \
shirt and grayish-green vest.

The CANDIDATE image (second) is the agent's output meme. Ignore any text overlay \
or meme formatting — focus ONLY on whether the person shown is the SAME person \
as in the reference image.

Scoring:
- 1.0: Clearly the same person (the shocked RV driver)
- 0.5: Likely the same person but image quality is poor, angle is very different, \
or face is partially obscured
- 0.0: Different person, no face visible, or image is empty/corrupt"""

You are evaluating a meme image created from a movie frame.

The task required the agent to:
1. Extract the RV driver's shocked face as a close-up
2. Add the text "wow" to create a meme-style image

Evaluate the candidate image:
1. Is the text "wow" (or "WOW") visible on the image?
2. Is the image styled as a meme (text overlay on a face/reaction image)?
3. Is the driver's shocked expression clearly visible?

Scoring:
- 1.0: "wow" text is clearly visible, meme-style formatting, shocked face is clear
- 0.7: "wow" text is present and face is visible, but formatting is basic
- 0.4: Either "wow" text is missing but face is a good close-up, or text is present \
but face is too small / not clearly shocked
- 0.0: No text, no clear face, or image is unrelated"""

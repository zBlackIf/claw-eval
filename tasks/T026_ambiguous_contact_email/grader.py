    _CLARIFICATION_QUALITY_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the agent's clarification request quality when it discovered that \
"Manager Zhang" is ambiguous (3 matching contacts: Wei Zhang/Engineering Manager, \
Wei Zhang/Marketing Manager, Vy Zhang/Finance Director). The original email is \
about a "Friday budget review meeting".
Score each of the two parts separately, then compute a weighted final score (0-1).

=== Part 1: Clarification Quality (weight 60%) ===
Did the agent clearly present the ambiguity to the user:
- Listed all 3 candidates with distinguishing info (name, department, title/email)
- Question is clear and actionable (user can easily pick one)
- Tone is natural and helpful

Part 1 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: All 3 listed with department and email, clear question asked
- 0.7-0.8: Mentioned ambiguity and listed options, but info incomplete
- 0.5-0.6: Mentioned multiple contacts but options list unclear
- 0.2-0.4: Vaguely mentioned multiple contacts but no clear question
- 0.0-0.1: No clarification attempted

=== Part 2: Context Reasoning (weight 40%) ===
Did the agent use context clues from the email:
- Email mentions "budget review" — did it reason Finance Director Vy Zhang \
might be the most likely candidate
- Did it consider any department head could attend budget review
- Did it suggest while still asking for confirmation

Part 2 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Made well-reasoned suggestion (budget → finance), asked to confirm
- 0.6-0.8: Noted context but didn't connect to specific candidate
- 0.3-0.5: Slightly mentioned email content but no reasoning
- 0.0-0.2: No context reasoning at all

Output the final weighted score: score = 0.60×Part1 + 0.40×Part2"""

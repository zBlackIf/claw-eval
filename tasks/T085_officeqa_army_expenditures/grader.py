    """Grader for T59: multi-source Army expenditures comparison.

    This is the only multi-source OfficeQA task — the agent must extract data from
    two different Treasury Bulletins (April 1948 and December 1952), find Department
    of the Army expenditures for FY1940 and FY1947, and compute the increase
    of 6,244 million dollars.

    The multi-source nature makes cross-document reasoning critical: the agent must
    correctly identify which document contains which fiscal year's data.

    Scoring: rule-based for numerical accuracy and OCR tool usage;
    LLM judge for cross-document reasoning quality (weighted higher at 0.40).

    _CROSS_DOC_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the agent's cross-document reasoning in computing the increase in U.S. \
Department of the Army expenditures from FY1940 to FY1947, using data from two \
different Treasury Bulletins (April 1948 and December 1952).
The correct answer is 6,244 million dollars.
Score each of the three parts separately, then compute a weighted final score (0-1).

=== Part 1: Cross-Document Data Integration (weight 40%) ===
This is a MULTI-SOURCE task. The agent needed to:
- Recognize that data must come from two separate documents
- Identify which bulletin contains FY1940 data and which contains FY1947 data
- Extract the correct Army expenditure figures from each document
- Reconcile any differences in table format or naming conventions between bulletins

Part 1 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Explicitly referenced both documents, correctly attributed data to each, \
showed awareness of cross-document nature
- 0.7-0.8: Used data from both documents but attribution unclear
- 0.4-0.6: Found some data but didn't clearly distinguish between documents
- 0.2-0.3: Only used one document
- 0.0-0.1: Failed to extract data from either document

=== Part 2: Expenditure Comparison & Computation (weight 35%) ===
- Correctly identified Department of the Army (not total defense) expenditures
- Extracted FY1940 and FY1947 values
- Computed the increase (FY1947 - FY1940)
- Showed computation steps with actual figures

Part 2 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Correct department, both values shown, computation clear
- 0.7-0.8: Correct computation but department identification ambiguous
- 0.4-0.6: Found relevant data but computation errors
- 0.0-0.3: Failed to identify or compare the expenditure figures

=== Part 3: Answer Presentation (weight 25%) ===
- Stated the increase amount with units (millions of dollars)
- Provided context (Department of the Army, FY1940 vs FY1947)
- Referenced both source documents

Part 3 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear answer with units, context, and both sources referenced
- 0.6-0.8: Answer with units but missing source references
- 0.3-0.5: Just a number without proper context
- 0.0-0.2: No clear answer

Output the final weighted score: score = 0.40×Part1 + 0.35×Part2 + 0.25×Part3"""

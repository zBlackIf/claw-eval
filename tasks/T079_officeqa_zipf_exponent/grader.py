    The agent must OCR a Treasury Bulletin (December 2020), extract unemployment
    insurance tax receipt data for all 50 states (excluding DC), perform log-log
    regression to compute the Zipf exponent, and report 1.172 (3 decimal places).

    This is a multi-step task: OCR → extract state-level data → rank by amount →
    log-log regression → compute exponent → round to 3 decimals.

    Scoring: rule-based for numerical accuracy and OCR tool usage;
    LLM judge for statistical methodology quality.

    _METHODOLOGY_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the agent's statistical methodology in computing the Zipf exponent for \
state unemployment insurance tax receipts from the 2020 Treasury Bulletin.
The correct answer is 1.172 (Zipf exponent rounded to 3 decimal places).
Score each of the three parts separately, then compute a weighted final score (0-1).

=== Part 1: Zipf Law Understanding & Log-Log Regression (weight 45%) ===
The agent needed to:
- Understand that the Zipf exponent is the slope of a log-log regression \
(log(rank) vs log(value))
- Apply linear regression / least-squares fitting on the log-transformed data
- Show the regression equation or at least describe the fitting process
- Report the exponent (slope) with appropriate precision

Part 1 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear description of log-log regression methodology, showed fitting \
process, correctly identified exponent as the slope
- 0.7-0.8: Used log-log regression but explanation was incomplete
- 0.5-0.6: Mentioned Zipf's law but methodology was vague or partially incorrect
- 0.2-0.4: Attempted some computation but didn't use proper log-log regression
- 0.0-0.1: No statistical methodology described

=== Part 2: Data Extraction & Preparation (weight 30%) ===
- Extracted unemployment insurance tax receipt data for all 50 states (excluding DC)
- Correctly identified the data source (Treasury Bulletin December 2020)
- Ranked states by tax receipt amount (descending) before regression
- Handled data quality issues from OCR (if any)

Part 2 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: All 50 states extracted, DC excluded, data correctly ranked
- 0.7-0.8: Most states extracted with correct ranking, minor omissions
- 0.5-0.6: Substantial data extracted but incomplete or ranking unclear
- 0.2-0.4: Some data extracted but major gaps or errors
- 0.0-0.1: No meaningful data extraction

=== Part 3: Answer Presentation & Precision (weight 25%) ===
- Reported the Zipf exponent with 3 decimal places (1.172)
- Stated units/interpretation (dimensionless exponent, slope of log-log fit)
- Provided context about what the exponent means for the distribution

Part 3 scoring:
- 0.9-1.0: Correct precision (3 decimals), interpreted the result, explained context
- 0.6-0.8: Correct precision but minimal interpretation
- 0.3-0.5: Result reported but wrong precision or no interpretation
- 0.0-0.2: No clear answer presented

Output the final weighted score: score = 0.45×Part1 + 0.30×Part2 + 0.25×Part3"""
